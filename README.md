# Website-Portfolio

This is a portfolio website that I created in 2nd semester and added a couple of tweaks to.

I have removed the node_modules, so make sure to redownload them in the command prompt using: npm install. 
Then, to open thr project as locally, use: npm run start. 

I used Visual Studio Code to write all the html, css, and js components.
